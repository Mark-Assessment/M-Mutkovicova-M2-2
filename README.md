# Milestone 2 Project - Big Bang Theory Trivia Quiz

This project is designed to give people a little bit of entertainement while exercising their brain a little bit on a favourite subject.

## Users 

The intended users for this are:
1. New users just playing a game.
    - Fun to play.
    - Easy to understand.
    - Quick and not time consuming.
2. New users wanting to exercise their brain.
    - Stimulating for the brain.

    - Has plenty of replayability.
3. Existing users
    - Predictable.
    - Quick.
    - Understandable.

## Design

For this project, I decided to go for a simple clean design. The primary aim with this project was to figure out the mechanics of the quiz, rather than design something mindblowing.

However, I took inspiration from the Big Bang Theory logo for the colour scheme. I kept the rest of the design clean and simple - and used Bootstraps inherent button design.
